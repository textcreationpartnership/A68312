            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Indeed, as concerning the vulgar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, I vnderſtand no leſſe, and withall I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how the Father, or grand-Father of this, was the popular applauſe and acclamation for a while, &amp; thoſe vpcryes comming often to my eares, I ſaid as often I confeſſe,
<q>— O ſaclum inſipiens, &amp; infacetum!</q> Grieuing togeather with ſome litle indignation, that

                  <p>Which ſuperlatiue difference they obſerued (as I conceaue) rather in the ſpirit of writing, then in the wording. And namely they obſerue that his perſonall reproaches, his ſtyle of contumely, compared with the ciuil and mild compoſure of his aduerſary; his iocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and geering humor, with the others graue and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8626:3"/>menage; his fraudulent and ſophiſticall ſyllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, with his plaine &amp; regular diſcourſe; his lurking, and ſcotizing, and affecting obſcurity, his ouercaſting with miſt's of ſubtile interpretations his aduerſaries plaine wordes, ſeeking or making the Knot where it is not, parallel'd with the others opennes and endeauour to giue day to truth; laſtly his immethodicall ſtructure and digeſture of the whole worke confronted with the others perſpicuity and light of order, will appeare in this neerenes and vicinity much more contemptible, then if they ſtood aloof, and at diſtance in ſeuerall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
                  <p>Yet others ſay againe, that euen in this he was wiſe, and prouident in his generation: yea that ſurely ſome higher power directed his deſigne; as the Goddeſſe of wiſedome is ſaid to haue carried the arrow drawne at the breſt of <hi>Menelaus</hi> vpon his belt, &amp; ſo of no force to wound as was intended, but yet inough to occaſion continuance of the War, and the enſuing victory of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> that by theſe two prouiſions diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, of God &amp; <hi>M. Ch.</hi> (if this commiſſion be not yet more odious then the former) many things are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted commodious to all ſides.</p>
                  <p>To his aduerſary; whoſe worke by this opportunity is euery man's money, and in euery mans hand's <hi>Cum Priuilegio,</hi> hath his protection from his aduerſarie; and out of a ſtrange miſtaking Charity, is permitted to fight vnder his Shield, like a little <hi>Teucer</hi> vnder his cozen <hi>Aiax</hi> buckler, ſhooting not only at the common enemy, but euen at <hi>Aiax</hi> himſelfe, out of a like confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence perhap's that, hauing combatted himſelfe, and hauing beene too hard for himſelfe ſo often, he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable by any other,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8626:4"/>
                     <q>Nec quiſquam Aiacem poterit ſuperare, niſi Aiax.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Commodious to the reader, who hath the ioint-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at an eaſier rate both of price and pain's; hath now no more to do, but turne the leafe, and (if he pleaſe) ſing a new ſong: yet with this odd's, I confeſſe, that while he read's, or hardly read's the Catholique volume miſerably contracted like another <hi>Homer</hi> into a nut-ſhel; he beholds the Proteſtants Atturney like a new <hi>Edgar</hi> vnder ſaile, gloriouſly ſwelling in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played Characters,
<q>Vt populus tumido gaudeat Antimacho.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gainfull laſtly to himſelfe, who by this co-impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion becomes more vendible, and makes a more ſwift returne of the commodity; his friends buy him more greedily, out of an appetite and curioſity to ſee the man, committed face to face with his aduerſarie, how manfully he beſtir's himſelfe. The friends of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie perhap's conuinc'd with the euidence of his diſcourſe and deductions, will be couetous to ſee what can be ſaid to theſe; how ſuch arguments will be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; how the Aduocate will vnty the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot like an <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or like an <hi>Alexander:</hi> All men I thinke, after ſo large and low'd promiſes of an vtter confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be deſirous to vnderſtand,
<q>Quid dignum tanto ferat hic promiſſor hiatu.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus all ſides, a man would thinke, will be pleaſed, and he, the author of this co-impreſſion, moſt of all; who hauing beene at great charges, and hauing his money out vpon the worke, would gladly, no doubt, ſee it backe againe, together with the fruite of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. And to ſay ſooth, who ſow's but he would reape? who plant's a vineyard but he would eat the fruit therof?</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:8626:4"/>
                  <p>I haue met with ſome other Cenſurers, who in my iudgment proceed too far this way, taking the boldnes to penetrate thoſe <hi>adita,</hi> thoſe very conclaues of men's intentions. And, whereas there are to be conſidered two ends in euery artificiall worke, the one intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, the other extrinſique, the former the end of the Art, the later of the Artiſt; this being ſo ſacred, that he might iuſtly interdict all ingreſſe to any mortal man, might paint two ſnakes at the entrance with this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphe,
<q>— Sacer hic locus, extra &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet to ſuch an Hyperbole of preſumption are men arriued in this age, that enter they will like any Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, into the very in-roomes, and bowels of the moſt ſecret counſail's and deſignes of other men. But while by gloſſing his intention they will ſeeme forſooth to excuſe him, in my opinion, they do but geere him; who, as though they had heard what he ſpake in his hart, take vpon them to perſonate him in his owne words.</p>
                  <p>What I do in this writing for Proteſtant's, I do it not, out of malice; nor out of any ill will towards the cauſe I impugne, no nor good will towards the cauſe I propugne: but, <hi>(vt verum fabuler,)</hi> to deale plainly with you, reflecting vpon my ſelfe ſtanding thus neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral between two potent factions, and being now as weary as any Poſthorſe with Canterburying ſo oft from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> and from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and by all theſe iourney's and defatigations, hauing gained nothing by either but ſweat and iealouſie; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling often to mind the wiſe ſentence of <hi>Salust, Frustra niti, neque aliud ſe fatigando, niſi odium quaerere, extremae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiae eſt;</hi> t'is mere madnes to take paines to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8626:5"/>to make no other purchaſe, but diſpleaſure; I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon a courſe how to endeare my ſelfe vnto one, and the rather to that part, which profeſſed moſt fayth, as the moſt likely to belieue me. But theſe truly I hold to be but idle comment's and ſurmiſes, wholy Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox from his true meaning and intention.</p>
                  <p>As that likewiſe of ſome others, that by theſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his turn's and return's, he affects a Name, to make himſelfe knowne to the world, vpon that knowledge and diffamation to raiſe his fortunes; or to lye like a foot-ball betweene the Goales, to become the ambition of Competitors,
<q>— Multorum ſpes inuidioſa procorum:</q> and then, a <hi>Qui plus, qui potior est ad dandum &amp;c.</hi> win me, and weare me.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Feſcennine</hi> liberty of Cenſure, for myne owne part, I vtterly diſlike. For I loue the man, and wiſh he may ſo come off after all theſe changes, that he may not be loued without a riual. And t'is well, yea ſurely a ſingular argument of Gods goodnes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, that the things in nature moſt neceſſary for man's vſe, are the readieſt at hand, and the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious acqueſt: as euen here, for this aduocate, I hold it much more eaſy to become a good Chriſtian, then to be thought ſo.

                  <p>To returne now to the matter in hand, permitting theſe and many the like cenſures to his verdict who

If more then this, any perſonal touch of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure chance to fall from my vnwilling pen, meeting with his like humor and begotten of it, as <hi>ſimile gignit ſibi ſimile,</hi> like begets the like, heate produce's heat, &amp; fire produce's fire; and as his perſonall humor running along through his diſcourſe (indeed a very ſalt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor) may caſt ſome ſalt into my pen, I ſhall hope that a reaſonable defence or excuſe may be preſumed from any indifferent man, euen out of the conſideration of theſe Premiſes; wherin alſo I can eaſily maintaine a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt intention, as to ſhew the man himſelfe in a conuenient diſtance from himſelfe, for that indiſtancy of the obiect is wont to hinder ſenſation. In the meane tyme verily it may ſeeme an incredible effect of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Philautie,</hi> or <hi>Authadie,</hi> or what elſe you will pleaſe to call that darke and cloudy affection, able to put out the light of the ſun at midday, if it could reach it, that a man otherwiſe rational, yea who makes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his Oracle, his Card, his Cynoſure; witty too, yea an idolater of wit, ſhould owe ſo little to either, as not to haue diſcouered his owne, ſo many groſſe follies er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, vanities, indecencies, yea inciuilities; beſides his ſo many fraudes and ſhiftes, and Paralogiſmes and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies, his wilfull and affected miſtakinges and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderſtanding his Aduerſary, and the like, for which his conſcience hath more to anſwere then his wit; and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8626:6"/>that after making ſo large an oſtentation of all kind of literature, he ſhould do nothing elſe in all, but abuſe all; and fall ſo ſhort of the expectation of thoſe who knew him, that now they can by no meanes know him, in his <hi>Worke.</hi> For my owne part, I haue beene ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to thinke the Worke none of his who entitles it; or his ſo altered, and Sophiſticate, that he may iuſtify the diſclayming it: Therefore as conceaued ſuch vpon good groundes I ſhall make the more bold with it.</p>
                  <p>Now then only to ſatisfy your intreaty, what I haue heere cenſured in general termes, I ſhall apply to particulars as they lye in my way, whyle I run along with this <hi>whoſoeuer,</hi> or <hi>incerti generis</hi> Author; but yet ſo, as to be at liberty, to take vp when I liſt.

Now faine would I know how many rhemes of paper may vindicate a Booke from the contempt of a Pamphlet? In my opinion a large volume <hi>in folio</hi> may be a Pamphlet in ſubſtance, and a Manuall booke of a very few ſheets may contain the waight &amp; worth of an ample volume.

And to deale plainly and ſeriouſly with the man, if all the <hi>Parerga's,</hi> or impertinences of his booke were culled out, and the ſolid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines bound vp by themſelues, this would be a very Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phlet indeed, much leſſe then either of the two ſo termed by him, <hi>M.

                     <p>Or how knowes he the Ieſuites conceaued any ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in anſwering <hi>D.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pref. I had good aſsurance, that in framing this building, though you were the only architect, yet you wanted not many diligent handes to bring you in choyce materialls towardes it: nor of many carefull and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eyes to correct the errors of your worke.</hi>

But what of all this?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pref. And to aſſure himſelfe, that if his reſolution not to belieue it, were not built vpon the rocke of euident grounds and reaſons &amp;c. now the wynd, and ſtormes, and floodes were comming which would vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrow it.</hi>

Vnles in ſaying his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary was not more willing to effect ſuch an alteration, then himſelfe to haue it effected, he thought perhaps that his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary had no will at all to effect any ſuch alteration, as of one ſo often altered already, that to alter him againe would not quit the coſt; conceauing that after another alteration, he would be ſtill more eaſy to be altered then euer to be ſetled; who goes

                     <p>And yet I verily thinke you need not goe far to match this <hi>Goliath,</hi> this <hi>Pythagorique</hi> Tranſmigration: do but match him with himſelfe; if he fight not with himſelfe, yea if be not to hard for himſelfe, almoſt in euery page, &amp; in ſome oftner then once or twice, I dare be bound to anſwere the forfait. As euen name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this place, hauing boaſted his reſolution built vpon a rock, not to belieue the Roman Doctrine, very ſoone after he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he retaines <hi>a Trauailer's indifference,</hi> which way of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to take of ſo many way's as are now in the world. When will this indifferent Trauailer come to his iourneys end, who is not yet reſolued of his way, nor know's yet whether he be in it or no? Yea, and if he proue true to his principles, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be thus indifferent. So that if he haue gone twenty miles to day on the left hand of truth, he wil goe to morrow as many on the right, if he meete with a more apparent, or howſoeuer more preuailing reaſon, which may be nothing elſe perhaps but a better friend, or ſome greater commodity, or the like. The third day you ſhall haue him gone as far a third way; the fourth, a fourth way, and ſo forth: and a thouſand to one after many

                     <p>But where is now that inuincible Reſolution? Was it only a negatiue Reſolution not to belieue the Catholique doctrine? And hath that of all others deſerued ſo ill of him? Indeed he loſt his fellowſhip by it; but I preſume the Catholique would haue giuen him a better, had he but held out his yeares probation. Yet now it ſeeme's he is reſolued vpon euident grounds to be an indifferent Trauailer to all other Profeſſions, but neuer to belieue himſelfe againe, whatſoeuer he can obiect for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique. No, he hath belieued himſelfe that way twice alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and hath deceaued himſelfe: therefore now he will neuer more diſpute that queſtion with himſelfe againe, but with this reſolution before hand, either to confute, or not to belieue himſelfe.</p>

<note place="margin">Pref.</note> to tempt poore ſpirited men out of the way of conſcience and honesty, but very incongruous for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teachers or louers of truth.

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> By which very words of the Aduocate you ſee cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated the very contradictory of what he obiects againſt his Aduerſary, that he flyes the triall of light; whereas, by his owne confeſſion, he appeales from a leſſe to a greater light, from a priuate conference to a publique manifeſtation in print. For which appeale, beſides the forementioned, he might haue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8626:16"/>other iuſt cauſes; among the reſt this one conſideration, how the paſſages of ſuch a Conference might be written, and afterward cauſed to be printed by this Challenger, with how great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to himſelfe he might iuſtly ſuſpect, by the aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and vnfincere proceedings of ſome others of this Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates quality, in ſome former like Conferences yet in freſh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>Which feare and equity of Appeale to publique teſtimony by print, is yet further confirmed euen by this paſſage of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, wherein this Complainant is not aſham'd to publiſh to the world to his aduantage what had priuately paſt betweene him and his Aduerſary by the intermiſe of a common friend to both, to whom it was with all ſecrecy intruſted; both for this reaſon wherein the Plaintife is become his aduerſaries Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as you ſee, and thoſe many others fitter to paſſe in ſilence, his refuſall of Conference other then in print, was and is moſt reaſonable, and will ſatisfy all diſcreet and vnpartiall men, whether this Aduocate will or no.</p>
                     <p>But now beſides all this, the condition annexed to this ſo vehemently vrged Conference is moſt ridiculous, and indeed ſo manifeſtly cutting off all hope of any fruite to be reaped by it, that any prudent man will eaſily vnderſtand, that all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and importuning of a Conference, is nothing elſe but a faire floriſh, a vaine bragge, an oſtentation of valiance &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the quarrell. Forſooth the effect of this Conference ſhould be to conuince his Vnderſtanding (in which word it pleaſeth him to play as with a fether) <hi>who was reſolued</hi> (quoth he) <hi>not to be a Recuſant, if I were conuicted.</hi> Verily like inough; he would fall off once more from Recuſancy, rather then ſtand to the conuiction. But what if his ſtout Will ſhould preuaile ſo much with his Vnderſtanding, as neuer to yield it ſelfe conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c't, although it were? Againe the argument might be of it ſelfe conuincing, and yet not conuince his Vnderſtanding, which might proceed from the weaknes of his Iudgment, who would then ſay (as he is wont) that his Aduerſary walkes in clowd's, if his argument ſhould conclude out of principles of Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Diuinity, inueſted alſo in termes of the Schooles, ſuch as he would not be able to ſee through them the ſtrength of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;

<note place="margin">Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> Which I ſhall not doubt to note as a fallacious Calumny of this Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, who would make the world belieue that to be Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely and Calumny which is no ſuch thing.

But why, thinke you, hath he ſo miſalleaged his Aduerſaries words? Inſteed of theſe, <hi>This wiſe and Gallant nation can be of no religion if not Catholique,</hi> he hath them thus; as though his Aduerſary ſaid, wiſe and Gallant men can be of no religion, if not of his.

                     <p>When therefore, theſe probable or prudentiall Motiues attentiuely conſidered, haue wrought in the ſoules of men firſt an opinion, that ſuch a doctrine may be true; then perhaps a

                     <p>Now when they ſay, the aſſent to the Concluſion cannot be of greater firmity or certainty, then is the certainty, force, or firmity of the Premiſes, which are ſuppoſed only probable and prudentiall motiues; they ſeuer the Premiſes, and take them as conſidered in themſelues alone, not as they are indeed, in their Eleuation and Coniunction with the ſupernaturall power of grace.</p>

This is true when the Premiſes haue onely an vniuocall and naturall influence into the Concluſion: that is; when they impart only that force or value to the Concluſion, which they hold of their owne, and proper in right and title of nature or naturality: but where their in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Neither ought this to ſeeme ſtrange in ſupernaturall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions of cauſes; for euen in the courſe of nature, and in good Phyſiologie, an accident which is a far inferiour nature, may produce a ſubſtance, as heat (yea euen then when it is ſeparate from the ſubſtance of fire) produceth fire: the reaſon; becauſe although as heat, or as an accident, it holdes an inferiour place in nature, yet as it is the naturally-ioynt inſtrument of fire, in <hi>virtute cauſae principalis,</hi> in, or by vertue of the fire, it produceth fire: ſo likewiſe thoſe motiues only probable, though as ſuch vnable of themſelues, by reaſon of their improportion, yet in vertue of their principall agent, or prime moouer (which is the holy Spirit operating and mouing in the ſoule) &amp; conioyn'd and ſublimed by that prime mouer or agent, they may, and do diſpoſe to the producing of an infallible aſſent: but of this point he will offer a more proper occaſion to ſpeake hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But now, this is ſome part of the Calumny, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire things contradictory and impoſſible to be done:
<note place="margin">Pref.</note> and is this indeed an impoſſible requiſite, <hi>that we require a most certaine aſsent to beyielded to things in human reaſon impoſsible?</hi> for with this he chargeth vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwere, it is falſely ſuppoſed by him, that thoſe things whereunto we require a moſt certaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that is, an aſſent of diuine fayth, are in human reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. For if they be true, they are not in human reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, though they haue the ſemblance or appearance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in humane reaſon. No truth is vntruth to human reaſon; therefore no truth is impoſſible in human reaſon; for I ſuppoſe that diſtinction, of Truth Philoſophicall, and Truth Theologicall, many yeares ſince expulſ't the Vniuerſity. For truth, in the whole latitude, being the obiect of reaſon and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, it cannot be that any truth ſhould imply impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or repugnance to human reaſon or vnderſtanding; no more then that any thing corporally viſible, can inuolue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8626:27"/>or impoſſibility to be ſeene by a corporall eye-ſight. Therefore if they be vntruth's, let them be conuinc't to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth's; if they hold thoſe things to be impoſſible in human reaſon, which are aboue human reaſon, no meruaile if this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate belieue not the B. Trinity. He will ſay, perchance, now he belieues it; but how? for I aske him; Doth he yield a moſt certaineaſſent, that is, an aſſent of diuine fayth, to the B. Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that God is one God in three really diſtinct perſons? If he belieue it not with certainty of diuine fayth, he belieues it not as a Chriſtian: If he do belieue with that certainty of fayth, then he yield's a moſt certain aſſent to a thing as impoſſible in humane reaſon, as any other point of fayth required to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued with a moſt certaine aſſent. But why do I aske him? It appeares euen by theſe words, as well as by his words of mouth; vttered vpon the forementioned occaſion, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed belieues not the B. Trinity, no nor Incarnation, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, nor any ſuch thing impoſſible, in his ſtyle, to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, with any ſuch certainty of aſſent, as makes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and diſtinguiſhes him from an Infidell, or <hi>Socinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It appeares furthermore by what he writes in this place, that he would haue it ſufficient, to belieue ſuch myſteries, with a lower degree of Fayth. Now either this lower degree of fayth, is diuine fayth or no. If diuine, then the aſſent ariſing from ſuch fayth, is a moſt certaine aſſent; or an aſſent with certainty exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all deliberate poſitiue doubt concerning the obiect of fayth. If that lower degree be not diuine fayth, then it is not only a Iower degree of fayth, as differing from ſome other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine fayth, only in degree of certainty, or <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> according to more or leſſe certainty, as heat differ's from heat, and more white from leſſe white; but it is different in the very <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind of fayth; as diuine fayth, from human fayth, which differ euen in definition and Eſſence of fayth: Therefore the Catholique requiring diuine fayth, and teaching, not, this Iower degree of fayth, but this indeed, no diuine fayth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for the acquiring Eternall ſaluation; requireth no more then the Apoſtle doth, where he ſayth, <hi>fine fide impoſsibile eſt placere Deo,</hi> without fayth it is impoſſible to pleaſe, or ſerue God; meaning that fayth, which in that very place is by him
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8626:28"/>deſcribed to be, <hi>ſperandarum ſubctantia rerum, argumentum non ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parentium;</hi> the ſubſtance of things to be hoped, the argument of things not appearing, which no man can deny to be diuine fayth. Now to require ſuch fayth, (beſides the neceſſity of it) cannot poſſibly mooue <hi>any ſcorne to religion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pref.</note> but is rather moſt fit and congruous to beget a more honourable conceipt, &amp; due Veneration of diuine myſteries in faythfull ſoules. For thoſe other, who out of an exceſſe of an Hyperbolicall Pride, will ſeeme to ſcorne whatſoeuer ſtand's without their ſphere; or, becauſe they are not, will ſuppoſe there are no Eagles; we can expect no leſſe from them.

                     <p>It is falſe then, which he preſumeth <hi>Gratis,</hi> that we pretend no other ground, for the infallibility of the Church, but ſome texts of Scriptures; nor is our doctrine ſo incoherent to it ſelfe, but as before, and without Scripture, the Church could truly ſay, <hi>Viſum est ſpiritui ſancto &amp; nobis,</hi> it hath ſeemed good to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt and to vs: So if no Scriptures were now, the ſame Church guided by the ſame holy Ghoſt, might truly ſay, <hi>Viſum est ſpiritui ſancte &amp; nobis:</hi> yea and this very doctrine that the ſame holy Ghoſt, Spirit of truth, ſpeakes in the Church, we are taught not only by this and thoſe other texts of holy Scripture, but <hi>à priori,</hi> by the Church, vpon whoſe credit and teſtimony we receaue this Scripture.</p>
                     <p>For thus I vrge: Where was this Scripture, where the whole

And this Scripture of hart's, was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Hieremy:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Cap.</hi> 31.</note> Post dies illos</hi> (after thoſe days, that is, in the tyme of the Ghoſpell,) <hi>dabolegem meam in viſceribus eorum, &amp; in corde eorum ſcibam eam:</hi> I will giue my law in their bowels, and write it in their hart. There was then the Scripture, the Word of God, the Ghoſpell: There, I ſay, as in the <hi>Autographon,</hi> the authentique, the originall inſtrument; out of that authentique and originall, tranſcribed and copied out in parchment's or papers. If then, euery tranſcript, or copy retain's the credit of a true copy or tranſcript, ſo far forth as it is found agreeing with the originall; it followeth, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we receaue vpon the authority of Scripture, we receaue it firſt from, and vpon the credit of the Church: And what we read, or vnderſtand as Scripture, is to be compared with that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique, leaſt it may proue a falſe copy, which we preſume to be Scripture, or the word of God.</p>
                     <p>Since then the holy Ghoſt, euen to the conſummation of the world, reſideth in the Church of Chriſt, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; it followeth euidently, that the word of God is in the Church, as in the Authentique and Originall, but in writings of inke and paper, only as in Copies and Tranſcripts. What madnes then, what groſſe abſurdity is this, to belieue the Copy rather then the Originall? Or with what ſenſe can any man pretend to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this Copy or Tranſcript, as written with inke and paper, better then by the liuing voyce of the Author himſelfe of that anthentique &amp; originall, the Church? Since in the Church of Chriſt, and only there, reſides the Author of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, perpetually and ſucceſſinely writing them, and the verities contained in them, in the hart's and ſoules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, members of that Church, as they are vnited by vnity of one fayth, and charity with their head Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

                     <p>Whence it followes furthermore, that to ſay we receaue the Scriptures from the Church, but not the ſenſe and meaning of them, is to ſpeake contradictories. For both the meaning and vnderſtanding of Scriptures is in the Church, and only there with certainty and infallibility of interpretation, where that ſpirit dwel's, which alone can interprete infallibly, his owne authentique. And beſides, not the letter written, but the ſenſe and meaning of the writing, or the Verities therein contained, are the Scripture or word of God.

O tooto dull and deafe eares, which the ſingar of God hath neuer ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which cannot heare a voyce ſo lowd; and thoſe blind eyes, which read not thoſe letters, that moſt legible Scripture of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique truth, written in the bloud of all ages, ſince Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the world with his; and thoſe inominate, and vnlucky birds of night, who flying the triall of the day ſhining in the Church, as in the Tabernacle of the Sunne, run into couert, and obſcurity of darke Scriptures, the common rendeuous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of all Hereſies; which they do no leſſe abſurdely and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly, then as if in queſtion of right and title grounded in law, they would appeale from the ſuruiuing law-maker, to his written lawes; as they would ſay, giue vs your Law's in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and then leaue them to vs, we will not learne of you the vnderſtanding of them: for ſo, this euer-ſuruiuing Law-maker is the holy Ghoſt, preſiding in the Church in all iudgements &amp; queſtions of fayth; from whom there neuer can be any iuſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale; the Scriptures his lawes which are written primarily &amp; principally, in the ſoules and hart's and vnderſtandings of this Church.

                     <p>Therefore although we debate right and truth by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Scriptures, againſt the vniuſt vſurpers of them, to take from them thoſe ſtoln'e weapons, and recouer them to the true

For as in our natural body, one &amp; the ſame in diuiſible ſoule, informeth, and enlifeneth the daily new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and aggenerate matter of nouriſhment: ſo this ſpirit of truth informeth, as it were, and animateth with the ſpirit of Grace and truth, not only the whole myſticall body of Chriſt all at once, or once for all, but ſucceſſiuely euery acceding and new-borne member of the Church.</p>
                     <p>As therefore in proceſſe of naturall growth, we do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly learne that we are reaſonable ereatures; but by the very hauing a reaſonable ſoule, and the vſe thereof, we know it: ſo Catholiques do not properly learne, that the Catholique Church is inerrant, or infallible, but by being Catholiques we belieue it. For of this truth I do not ſee, but in a true ſenſe I might ſay; <hi>Est hac non ſcripta, ſed natalex: quam non didicimus accepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, legimus; verùm ex naturâ ipſâ arripuimus, hauſimus, expreſsimus: ad quam non docti, ſed facti; non inſtituti, ſed imbuti ſumus:</hi> A truth not written for vs, but borne in vs; which he haue not learned, nor acquired, nor read in bookes; but by a ſecond nature of Grace we are inſtantly poſſeſt of, we haue ſuckt it, and expreſt it; for which we haue beene made, not taught; indued with it, not ſchooled to it. Therefore I ſhould not doubt to auouch, though the whole rable of fleſh &amp; bloud, and hereſy reclaime, that it is (vnderſtanding it in equality of proportion) no leſſe innate and connaturall to a Catholique man, as ſuch to belieue that the Catholique Church is indued with infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then it is naturall to a reaſonable man, as ſuch, to know he is endued with a reaſonable ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as he ſhould be thought an abſurd and ſenſeles man, who ſhould goe about to perſuade a man by reaſon, that he hath not a reaſonable ſoule: ſo is he worthily iudged an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, pratling Sophiſt, who endeauours to argue a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique out of his beliefe of a Catholique infallible Church: which ſtone notwithſtanding, I know this Aduocate neuer

                     <p>If Hereſy be only the pretended cauſe, what is the latent &amp; true Cauſe which is pretexed or veiled vnder the name of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy?
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8626:36"/>What is that <hi>cauſa precatarchica,</hi> that chiefly &amp; prineipally, though couertly mouing cauſe, if this be the euident and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe only? As when in the age of our Fathers, ſome loſt their liues, vnder pretence of Treaſon, it was eaſy to aſſigne the true cauſe, practiſe, or profeſſion of ancient Religion made trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon by new Lawes. Let him likewiſe declare vnto the world the true cauſe, or cauſes pretenſ't and cloak't with the crime of Hereſy, in the procedures of Catholikes in thoſe their capitall ſentences and executions vpon Heretiques, other then their willfull obſtinacy in maintaining hereticall opinions.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe now, that Hereſy is puniſhable by death, euen in the opinion and practiſe of chiefeſt Proteſtants <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi>

                           <hi>Bellarm. de laicis l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 22:</note> and others; being alſo the knowne and receaued doctrine of Fathers and Councels, grounded vpon expreſſe teſtimonies of holy Scriptures. And this, a man would thinke to be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Aduocate; for euen in that he termes the killing of innocent men, vnder pretence of Hereſy, <hi>Murder;</hi> he ſhould ſeeme to intimate that death executed vpon Hereſy, not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but the true, and primely mouing cauſe, is not Murder, nor killing of innocent men. As he who calleth Death for Treaſon only pretended, <hi>Murder,</hi> ſuppoſeth that Treaſon it ſelfe truly ſo named, is iuſtly puniſhable by Death; will he then ſay, that thoſe opinions were not indeed Hereſies, but falſely ſuppoſed ſuch? or only made criminall vnder the name of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, and as ſuch, or inſteed of ſuch puniſhed by death? Which being neuer yet proued, but rather the contrary conuinc't by all the Arguments and profes wherby any opinion can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinc't hereticall, is in no wiſe now to be aſſumed.</p>
                     <p>And yet further, if thoſe opinions haue beene fore-iudged or fore-damned for Hereſies; Catholique poſterity hauing thoſe precedents, &amp; according to thoſe, ſentencing alike the very ſame Hereſies, cannot ſurely with any probability, be ſaid to haue proceeded to capitall condemnation of ſuch opinions, only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Hereſy. And if, notwithſtanding all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of Antiquity, authorities of Fathers, Councels &amp;c. defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch opinions to be Hereticall, what in after ages hath beene done according to thoſe precedent Decrees, and Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may be yet traduc't to a coulorable proceeding againſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8626:37"/>ſuch doctrines vnder pretence of hereſy: why may not likewiſe, in the ciuill Gouernment of all Chriſtian Common-wealths throughout the world, capitall proceedings againſt many cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in this preſent age, according to Precedents, &amp; Lawes of former tymes, be brought back into diſpute, and Iudges of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſes condemned for their pronouncing capitall ſentence againſt ſuch delinquents, and ſuch and ſuch demeanors, vnder pretence of capitall Crimes, being indeed (would theſe men ſay) no crimes at all, or not iuſtly puniſh't with death?</p>
                     <p>And ſurely, I belieue it will be hard for any Chriſtian, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy to Chriſtian doctrine, to thinke that laycke and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Precedents and Statutes, may not with as litle ſcruple be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called into queſtion, as Eccleſiaſtique Decrees; or to giue a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. why the authority of a Nationall Synod, Senate of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, ſhould be more inuiolable then the authority of an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall Councell; eſpecially if we conſider and belieue, that this later authority, both in regard of matter &amp; forme, the things decreed, and the manner of decreeing, is of a nearer approach and acceſſe to diuine Law's, and Ordinances, then the former.</p>
                     <p>If then, Sentences and Iudgments conformable to Senato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Parlamentory Statutes muſt not be eſteemed colours and pretences only; much more the ſentences and executions of the Church, in conformity to Eccleſiaſticall orders and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, cannot but abſurdly be preſumed to be only preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, veilings and maskings of ſome hidden miſtery of malice or pollicy.

He will giue no iudgment at all of any thing: he will not ſay the Crow is blacke to day, for feare he may ſay to morrow this a ſwan; nor that hony is ſweet to day, leaſt it may ſeeme gall to morrow. For all obiects affect their ſenſes, not by what they are in themſelues, but as the ſenſes are formerly affected; which affection or diſpoſition may vary daily; which variance or mutation, becauſe they foreſee not, therefore they can promiſe you no opinion of theirs for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

                     <p>ANother Fallacy I meet with euen in this place which we may rank with Fallacies of Diuiſion. For where his Aduerſaries diſcourſe hath his Arguments or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of proofe in ioynt connexion, and immediate ſubſecution of his Poſition; there this Sophiſter ſeuer's and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides the proofe from the Poſition, diſioynting and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them into ſo many ſenerall and diſparate propoſitions, without any relation or diſcurſiue conſecution of the one from the other: which Fallacy though it may ſeeme to fall naturally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8626:38"/>from the ſpring and ſpirit of Hereſy, and Schiſme, which in their very Notion and Etimology import <hi>diuiſon;</hi> yet I make no doubt, but it was voluntary heere, and of choyce, hauing in it the Authors ends, which were, I doubt not, to weaken his Aduerſaries diſcourſe; as if he would vnty the faggot, the more eaſily to breake the ſingle ſtick's, which in the whole faggot he could not do.</p>
                     <p>His aduerſaries poſition was this: <hi>The doctrine of Protestants followed cloſely and coherently to it ſelfe, induceth Socinianiſme; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly their doctrine denying infallibility of the Viſible Church of Chriſt.</hi> This propoſition he proueth immediatly: <hi>For if the infallibility of ſuch a publique authority be once impeached, what remaineth but that euery man is giuen ouer to his owne wit, and diſcourſe &amp;c.</hi> This reaſon he ſorth with declaring, and confirming by other reaſons with cloſe compacture, and conſiſtency of diſcourſe, becauſe it was ſtrong,

                     <p>Nor will it help this Aduocate, that ſoone after his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as it were directing his ſpeach to Catholiques, calleth that Church, our Church; for to Catholiques this needed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe, who belieue it already. Whence with them he might preſume it, as granted, according to that of <hi>S.

But you ſhall take him very often faultring in this Fallacy.
<note place="margin">Fallacy:</note> ante-dating his Aduerſaries order, and therefore ſeldome anſwering to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in hand; whereof hereafter inſtances will occurre very plentifully.</p>
                     <p>He wil ſay perhaps, he hath fore-inſerted his Aduerſaries diſcourſe entire, and as it lye's in his owne Booke; but to this I ſay againe, he anſwer's is not as it lyes there, but miſordreth it, to his aduantage, euen as formerly ordred by himſelfe. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to faire play and ingenuous behauiour, although he might do well, in anſwering the whole diſcourſe by retaile, or by parts; yet he ſhould haue taken notice of the relation and connexion of one part with another; and ſo haue anſwered rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's as reaſons, poſitions as poſitions, and not haue made euery
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8626:39"/>reaſon, a poſition. I know he hath learned to analize a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe better then ſo, and would eſteeme it poore Anatomy, only to diſſect limbe from limbe, ioynt from ioynt, and neuer ſhew the naturall commiſſure and compacture of limbe with limbe, &amp; ioynt with ioynt: nor diſtinguiſh them according to their true Nomenclature, and their ſeuerall, both proper, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, &amp; relatiue functions.</p>
                     <p>But he, as though the diſſected were only <hi>bellua multorum capitum,</hi> a beaſt with many head's; ſo he lectures vpon legs, thighs, belly, eyes, eares, armes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all vnder one appellation of Head, as though all the parts and members were heads; for iuſt ſo he hath anatomiz'd his Aduerſaries context of ſpeach, making euery part, as it were a ſeuerall head; and why? Becauſe as in a naturall body, by reaſon of that due order and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of members, a certaine mutuall intelligence of influences and ſympathies of the members betweene themſelues is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; of which mutuall intelligence and influence depends the life and vigor of euery part, and ioindy of the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For to this purpoſe which I haue ſaid (what other can be imagined) he hath deuided thoſe reaſons and confirmations of his Aduerſaries poſition, into ſo many heads or propoſitions, diſtinguiſhing them not only by numbers, as, <hi>you ſay first,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pref.</note> and <hi>you ſay againe; you ſay thirdly,</hi> then <hi>fourthly,</hi> then <hi>fiftly;</hi> but alſo by ſeuerally varying the odious phraſe; as <hi>you ſay confidently inough;</hi> then, <hi>you ſay with ſufficient confidence; thirdly, you ſay with conuenient boldnes; fourthly, you ſay with confidence in abundance,</hi> when all is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but one thing ſaid, the Propoſition with ſome few proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes adioyned. Yet the fauourers of his cauſe and perſon, would eaſily pardon this poore peece of Sophiſtry, or waue it at the leaſt, had he achieued his intent by this; but now <hi>Cuibone?</hi> what hath he got by this?

                     <p>Wherefore if the man be in his wits, he will find out his guide, and know him to be a ſure guide, before he put himſelfe into his iourney; otherwiſe both the guide and guided may fall into a ditch, whence neither his Logick-rules, nor all his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent deductions, with twenty ropes to boot, will euer be ſtrong inough to pluck him out. Now the only guide which guideth reaſon by Scripture is the holy Spirit, the only true and ſure interpreter of holy Scriptures. This holy ſpirit is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to any priuate man, but to the Church it is promiſed; therefore in this Church is infallibly to be found: whence he that followeth this company of men, not only followeth not <hi>a company of beaſts,</hi>

Now that one ſpirit (which is ſo one, that it cannot be a part of number, like as diuine vnity, or the vnity of diuine nature, is no part of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) that one ſpirit I ſay, is not to be tried; for it cannot be but a true ſpirit: otherwiſe no ſpirit could be knowne to be true, if that one ſpirit could befalſe, which is the only rule wherby to trie all ſpirits; but of the multitude of ſpirits, or partaking ſpirits ſome do, and all may, lye. Of which number of lying ſpirits, are the Apoſtate Angells fince their defection from the ſpirit of truth; and thoſe falſe Prophets in whoſe mouth's thoſe lying ſpirits were ſpeakers. Such alſo were thoſe Pſeudoprophets, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon occaſion of whom <hi>S. Iohn</hi> forewarneth Chriſtians <hi>not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue euery ſpirit, but to try ſpirits.</hi> And who were thoſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets or Apoſtles, thoſe lying ſpirits? They were thoſe of whom he had ſaid before, that they had beene in the Church, and were gone out of the Church, and therefore became lying ſpirits, oftentimes actually lying, always inclined and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to lye, and ſo neuer to be belieued.</p>
                     <p>For as that firſt reuolt from God, the ſpirit of truth, was the originall cauſe why thoſe mutinous ſpirits became lyar's: ſo Apoſtaſy from the Church of God, in whom the ſame ſpirit of truth preſides, is the generall origen, and extraction of all falſe Prophets and Heretiques. As therefore that one prime ſpirit, is none of thoſe ſpirits, euery one of which is to be tryed, but by which euery numerable ſpirit is to be proued: ſo the ſpirit which guideth the Church, is not a ſpirit to be tried, but that by which euery priuat ſpirit muſt be examined, and tried. In which ſenſe alſo it is moſt truly ſaid, <hi>Prima Sedes,</hi> the prime ſea is iudged by none: therfore it is true againe, that the Church of Chriſt, the Catholique Church, is the only competent iudge of it ſelfe, according to that receaued principle of naturall reaſon, <hi>rectum eſt iudex ſui, &amp; obliqui:</hi> what is ſtraight of it ſelfe, both ſhew's it ſelfe to be ſtraight, and what is crooked, to be ſo. He

<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dauiel</hi> 12.</note> he ſhall be the ſtarre, which would giue light to the Sunne, but none of thoſe who ſhall ſhine <hi>in perpetuas aternitates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For I would aske any man, only ſober, and in his wits, if the Church of God may haue erred, either in determining Scriptures, or the true meaning of them, (which point concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Scriptures I ſpecifie, to preuent all refuge to trial by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) by what other ſpirit ſhall this ſpirit of the Church be tried? And I would gladly looke vpon that face of Impudence, that would aſſume to it ſelfe, what it denyeth to the Church of God: and when I ſhall haue found him, I ſhall know for certaine, that he is one of thoſe Antichriſts, of whom the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Et nunc Antichriſti multi facti ſunt.

Whence the whole mortall kind of man is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently deuided by theſe two names, the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> therfore, that going out of the Church, ſignified by thoſe words, <hi>prodierunt ex nobis,</hi> they went out from vs, could be no whither elſe, but into the world, there being no third place, or family of mortall men to go vnto; therefore all Heretiques are a part of that faction, the World; and therefore being indued &amp; ſwayed, and guided by the ſpirit of the world, which is a lying ſpirit, they cannot be competent Iudges or Examiners of the ſpirit of the Church, or any doctrine of fayth, or interpretation of Scriptures. But as the Church Triumphant ſhall iudge the world and condemne it, and ſhall not be iudged by it; ſo the Church now Militant, is inueſted with the like authority and iuriſdiction towards mortall men of this world, to iudge and condemne the world, that is, all thoſe who are ſeuered from her Society, and not to be iudged by them. Her doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the ſole Iudicature both of it ſelfe, and all other crooked and oblique opinions. Wherefore the counſaile of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> to try ſpirits, is to trie them by the ſpirit and doctrine of the Church; for vnles the ſpirit of the Church were ſuppoſed the ſpirit of truth, they could not haue beene iudged falſe Prophets for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Church, no nor for oppoſing the doctrine of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, that by which another thing is tried, as by a rule, muſt needs be ſuppoſed more perfect in regard of Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the thing tried: but it is abſurd to thinke that the ſpirit of a priuate man is more perfect in nature of Iudicature, then the ſpirit of the Church; therefore <hi>S. Iohn</hi> neuer aduiſed priuate men to try the ſpirit of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, this very command or aduiſe, <hi>Try euery ſpirit,</hi> is the aduiſe of the Church it ſelfe, in the perſon of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> a principall pillar of the Church; but no man can be ſo ſilly, as to thinke that the Church aduiſeth priuate men, to try her ſpirit (and leaſt of all can Heretiques challenge any ſuch authority.) Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques alſo are ſubiects of the Church, euen in that, they are, at the leaſt, characterically Chriſtians, which character of ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they can neuer wipe out wherſoeuer they run; they are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8626:42"/>euer ſubiects, though rebells; therfore their calling the Church to queſtion and triall, is mere preſumption, and an act of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. No Catholique preſumeth to trie the ſpirit or doctrine of the Church; nay euery Catholique trieth his owne ſpirit and doctrine by that of the Church; therefore a Catholique, as ſuch, hath no priuate opinion of fayth, but all Catholique, that is, the ſame with the whole Catholique Church.</p>
                     <p>The Catholique makes no choyce of doctrines of fayth but taketh ſuch as are giuen him: he is Gods beggar, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no chooſer. <hi>Ego autem mendicus ſum &amp; pauper,</hi> I am a beggar and poore. Thus euery Catholique is taught both to ſay and belieue. The Heretique makes choyce of what he will hold with the Church, takes what he liſt's, and refuſeth what he liſt's not take. And this is to be euen Etimologically an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and an Heretique formally, no leſſe in what he takes, then in what he refuſes. For what he takes he chooſeth to take vpon his owne diſcretion, not vpon the credit of the Church, nor formally from the Church: therefore he is an Heretique in all, euen in the points of diuine fayth, which he holdeth with the Church, not of the Church; and therfore holdeth nothing with diuine fayth, becauſe he is ſtill a chooſer of what he holds, and ſo an Heretique.</p>

Howſoeuer he giues me a warrant by his example, to ſyllogize his looſe Periods, &amp; ſhape them into Logicall-formes. Which, for my part I profeſſe to do, with much more fidelity then he doth; wherein I will appeale to the iudgement of other men, yea and eſpecially of thoſe his more learned and more ſober Co-academiques.</p>
                     <p>Thus then he argueth: <hi>Diſcourſe truly ſo called miſguideth no man: Drawing concluſions out of Scriptures by good conſequence, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe truly ſo called.</hi> Ergo, <hi>drawing Concluſions out of Scripture &amp;c. miſguideth no man.</hi> To this I anſwere, that although Diſcourſe truly ſo called miſguideth no man, <hi>ex vi formae,</hi> by that forme of lawfull diſcourſe; yet <hi>ex vi materiae,</hi> in regard of the matter, it often doth: But, <hi>drawing of concluſions out of Scripture by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is diſcourſe truly ſo called;</hi> this I diſtinguiſh. Drawing them out of Scriptures formally taken, that is, truly vnderſtood, and this by good conſequence, <hi>is diſcourſetruly ſo called,</hi> I yeild; Out of the Scriptures taken only materially, that is, out of the words of Scripture falſely interpreted, I deny it. For it is only an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and fallacious diſcourſe; therefore not diſcourſe truly ſo called.</p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:8626:47"/>
                     <p>Now, to his Confirmation: The principles whence we draw theſe concluſions, that is, the holy Scriptures are agreed on by all, to be infallibly true; what is that to the purpoſe, if it be not agreed, in what ſenſe they are true? Therefore I ſay, the premiſes may be true, the conſequence lawfull and good, and ſo the concluſion true, according to ſome ſenſe of the premiſes: but becauſe that ſenſe may be a falſe ſenſe, though the premiſes of themſelues be true; therefore the diſcourſe, or whole Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifme may deceaue and lead into error; yea euen ſo much the more, becauſe the conſequence is good.</p>
                     <p>But his Aduerſary hath told him, in the 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Pamphlet (ſo he, ſtill like to himſelfe, nibling, and detracting from his Directors credit) <hi>That from truth, no man can by good conſequence inferre falshood.</hi> He tels him, what <hi>S.

The Scriptures are always materially true, that is, true in themſelues, and from them as true, no fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood can be conſequent; but they may be, and are commonly falſely ſenſed and interpreted, and that purpoſely, by Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques; therefore from them as falſely interpreted, falſhood may, and doth follow, euen by good conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Well then, to open the Fallacy <hi>(Vlceris os)</hi> and ſo to let out the corruption: Scriptures falſely interpreted are not the Word of God, but the word of man, the falſe Interpreter; therefore they who are guided by Scriptures ſo interpreted (and now the word of man) may be miſguided, and are ſo, euen by thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures (now not holy, but prophaned by man.)</p>

                        <hi>Pref. YOu ſay thirdly with ſufficient confidence. If the true Church may erre in defining what Scriptures be canonicall, or in deliuering the ſenſe thereof, we muſt follow either priuat ſpirit, or naturall wit, &amp; iudgement, and by them examine what Scriptures containe true or falſe doctrine.</hi> Thus the Aduocate: and what ſayth he to this? <hi>All this</hi> (fayth he) <hi>is apparently vntrue, neither can any proofe of it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi>

His Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary argues thus; <hi>The authority which must determine what Scripture is Canonicall, or what is the true ſenſe of ſuch Scripture, is either the Church of God, or priuate ſpirit, or naturall wit, and iudgment. Not the Church, according to Protestants, therefore either the priuate ſpirit, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wit &amp;c.</hi> If this diuiſion be good, then the inference is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently true; if it be not good, let him ſhew the inſufficiency of the enumeration. Yes.</p>

                        <hi>Pref. Other direction we haue</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>beſides either of theſe three; and that is, the teſtimony of primitiue Chriſtians.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw. Ridiculus mus!</hi> But do you marke the ſubtility of the Logician, how ſliely he euades and ſhifts the neceſſity of being directed by a true Church, or by the ſpirit, or by naturall wit? <hi>We haue befides theſe, the testimony of primitiue Chriſtians.</hi> And do
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8626:48"/>thoſe primitiue Chriſtians make a fourth member in this diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of direction, diſtinct from the other three? What difference betweene primitiue Chriſtians, and primitiue Church? and then, what difference to our purpoſe, betweene the primitiue Church, and the true Church? which is the Church, to which his Aduerſary challengeth this right of direction. So himſelfe apparently granteth, what he ſo deſperately auoucheth to be apparently vntrue, and whereof no proofe can be pretended. Wherein I alſo note a Fallacy of fact,
<note place="margin">Fallacy.</note> and fraudulent dealing; his endeauouring to make his Aduerſaries doctrine odicus to the ignorant Reader, by his confident or impudent reiection of his reaſon, and branding it with this Cenſure, <hi>all is apparently vntrue &amp;c.</hi> when afterwards he granteth in effect all. Surely he hopes his Aduerſary will be ſo blind as neuer to perceaue this grant, while he ſayth not the ſame his Aduerſary doth, in the ſame words. For inſteed of his aduerſaries <hi>true Church,</hi> he hath <hi>Primitiue Christians;</hi> and why not <hi>Primitiue Church?</hi> as wel might you aske the Diuell, why not holy-water? The very word (Church) is Exorciſme to all Hereſy, as the name of IESVS to infernal fiends.</p>
                     <p>Another pelting fallacy you may obſerue,

And why this? Becauſe he had ſomthing which he could except againſt this examination, of contents, by ſhewing how it may faile in direction. But what then? Who giues this examination the office of Director? Not his aduerſary. Nay rather, becauſe it may faile, and may meete with many difficulties, hence his Aduerſary inferreth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Director, by whoſe aſſiſtance Chriſtians may make this examination of Scriptures, and be aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8626:48"/>
                        <hi>mera Chymera;</hi> he will take heed of ſaying ſo. Well then, what other thing if not the true Church? No other thing, forſooth, but another Word. What? the <hi>Primitiue Chriſtians?</hi> Do you marke how neere he came to the Church, and yet eſcap't it? Not the Church, not the true Church, not the Primitiue Church, but <hi>primitiue Chriſtians. O Scotus!</hi> O ſubtility of diſtinction! moſt true; the very name of Church ouerthroweth Proteſtancy. But why not againe primitiue Church, as well as <hi>Primitiue Christians?</hi> He knew a primitiue Church will infer a deriuatiue Church; it carrieth in the very common notion and obuious ſignification of the word, the nature of a Body, a Society, a Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the kingdom of Chriſt; in that Church and kingdom, order and ſubordination, commaund and ſubiection will by neceſſary ſequele, force a neceſſity of perpetuity and viſibility; in which propriety it muſt differ from the Synagogue. This is therefore a terrible hearing to Proteſtancy, a Church; <hi>Terribilis vt castrorum acies ordinata,</hi> terrible as an army in battaile-array.</p>
                     <p>Now, for <hi>Primitiue Chriſtians,</hi> they imply no ſuch order, no ſuch coordination, or ſubordination, as of a body, and therefore as ſo many ſcattered ſheep, they might wholy dye in their owne aſhes, not Phenix-like ſuruiue in their poſterity; which to affirme of a Church of Chriſt, his eſtabliſh't Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or kingdom, purchaſ't by right of Conqueſt, with the ineſtimable price of his blood, is not only Hereticall, but moſt impious and prophane; ſince neither the Synagogue and Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> became euacuate, or abrogate <hi>viâ corruptiuâ,</hi> by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptiue deſition; but paſt into a Church &amp; Euangelicall Law <hi>via perfectiuâ,</hi> as Chriſt was the perficient, not the corruptiue end of the Law: <hi>Non veni legem ſoluere, ſed adimplere &amp;c.</hi> I came not to diſſolue, but to fulfill the Law &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And I pray you obſerue his notorious method; his Cenſure is, for the moſt part, the preface to his Anſwere: when he hath firſt ſtruck his Aduerſary on the head, or wounded his reputation, with ſome calumny, or contumely; then he wil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the matter not only cooly, but very coldly, as you ſhall ſee. In the meane tyme, ſince he is ſo liberall of contumelious and reproachfull language, if we ſpare him, it is mere gratuite grace, no merit of his, not ſo much as of congruity; nay it may ſeeme much more congruous, to ſhew the man his error, where he may ſee it better then in himſelfe. For I belieue it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to any vnderſtanding man, euen by the <hi>Genius</hi> of his ſtile, that he hath drunke more liberally of <hi>Narciſsus</hi> Well, then of <hi>Aristotles,</hi> as neere as it ſprings. Whence I do not ſee, but his Preſident way be my Apology; and very Charity will require, that ſome ſprinkling of ſalt be employed vpon his ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſity. Now marke the Fallacy.</p>
                     <p>His aduerſary ſayth, <hi>Take away the authority of Gods Church, no man can be aſsured &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>(Gods Church)</hi> this Atturney changeth <hi>(your Church)</hi> as though his aduerſary preaſſumed, what is in queſtion with Proteſtants. Which he purpoſely doth not, but only ſheweth the neceſſity of a Viſible Church, and infallible authority shereof. The fallacy of this change hath this intent, to make his aduerſary more odious for his preaſſuming &amp; anteda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; as alſo, that he may impugne him more eaſily, where he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8626:49"/>contends not; which he doth almoſt euery where; neuer ſtrikes where his Aduerſary wards: So he ſeldome or neuer argues, or anſweres to the matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>But why now is this an vntruth void of modeſty? <hi>Becauſe</hi> ſayth he, <hi>the experience of innumerable Christians is against it; who are ſufficiently aſſured that the Scripture is diuinely inſpired, and yet deny the infallibility of your Church, or any other.</hi>

And is it immodeſty in a Roman Catholique, to defend and proue the contrary to that which the Aduerſaries of that Church would proue, and do teach, whereby to ouerthrow that Church, and with that all Chriſtianity? But to ſhew him the weaknes of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I forme the like: Innumerable Chriſtians are ſufficiently aſſured, that no man can be aſſured of any parcell of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture otherwiſe, then by the authority of the Church of God; <hi>Ergo, M.

And were not they the Church of God? and hath any other told vs they are diuine, and of diuine authority, but they primarily, and their poſterity after them? Can any man expect a more certaine teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his owne, or any other mans birth, then from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who brought him forth into the world? Was not the holy Scripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued of the holy Ghoſt, as it were in the wombe of the Church? Yea thoſe ſoules and ſpirits of Prophets, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Apoſtles, in which thoſe Scriptures were conceaued euen formally as diuine, together with the truth contained in them, were they not before thoſe Scriptures were brought to light? And could any but they, or vpon their credit belieue thoſe Scriptures were of diuine yſſue; conceaued, I ſay, in thoſe ſpirits diuinely inſpired and illuminated? yea and from them flowing, as from a vitall principle, actually, and actiuely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing into thoſe conceptions, togeather with the holy ſpirit of truth?</p>
                     <p>Whence alſo it followeth euidently, that thoſe diuine truth's cannot be the formall conceptions of any ſoule, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, not endued and eleuated by this ſpirit of truth; with which ſpirit ſince no man can aſſure himſelfe to be endued, &amp; yet euery Chriſtian ought to belieue, as certaine, that the Church of God is indued; therefore euery Chriſtian ought to receaue thoſe diuine truths contained in Scriptures, togeather with the Scriptures themſelues, from the Church of God, whoſe lawfull iſſue, and ofſpring they are.</p>
                     <p>Neither can this in reaſon ſeeme to a Chriſtian any whit derogatory, from the maieſty of the diuine word, to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſpirit of man; no more then it was, from the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of the Sonne of God to be conceaued in the wombe of the B. Virgin Mary: and that, as there the Eternall Word was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted with humane fleſh; ſo heere in theſe ſpirits of men, as in the wombe of the Church, the Word of God, ſowne by the holy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8626:50"/>Ghoſt, ſhould be inueſted with humane notion, and brought forth to light of the world, in the guiſe of humane ſpeach and voyce. In which ſenſe we may interprete that teſtimony of the holy Baptiſt, <hi>Ego vox clamantis,</hi> I am the voyce of the cryer; as his voyce was the inueſture of that Word of the holy Ghoſt crying in the deſert, by which it was conueyed to the eares of mortall men: ſo is the voyce and declaration of the Church, the meanes by which the Word of God, and all Truth contained in it, is conueyed to our ſoules and vnderſtandings. And as that cry of the Holy Ghoſt was firſt conceaued in the ſpirit of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> then vttered by his voyce to the world: ſo theſe Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res were firſt conceaued in the Church, thoſe Apoſtolicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in which they were firſt imprinted, and inueſted (if I may ſo ſpeak,) by the operation and Energy of that fire which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in tongues, afterwards vttered vpon due occaſions in words and writings. As therefore thoſe of that tyme heard the voyce of that cryer in the deſart, from the mouth of the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> ſo all Chriſtians heare, and muſt heare the word of God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine truth, by the mouth of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Well then, what this man ſo confidently auerreth, that there is no ground, yea that no ground can be pretended, why we ſhould hold Gods Church (for ſo he muſt ſay, if he ſay any thing againſt what his Aduerſary ſayes,) infallible, vnles we firſt belieue the Scripture diuine; I as confidently deny. And for as much as reſpects priority, or antecedency of beliefe, ſince the Scripture, as I haue ſaid, is no other word, but what the Church hath, and daily doth vtter vnto vs, whether hiſtoricall or dogmaticall, or howſoeuer firſt conceaued in the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſpirit of the Church; it followeth, that as we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued it vpon her credit, telling and teaching vs, that it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine; ſo we muſt <hi>à Priori,</hi> belieue the Church, as infallible wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or reporter, before we can belieue the infallibility of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which ſhe reporteth: it followeth alſo, that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Church interpreting the Scripture; for it is incredible, that any other man ſhould better vnderſtand what I ſpeake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I haue conceaued, or what I meane by the words I ſpeake, then I my ſelfe, the ſpeaker, who only intend to vtter my conceipt.</p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:8626:51"/>
                     <p>It followeth yet further, that although there were no Scripture, and theſe Chriſtian Verities had deſcended to vs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Tradition, and by the teſtimony of former ages, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them ſucceſſiuely from Chriſt, to this preſent age; we ſhould be bound to belieue the Church: that is, that continued ſucceſſion of men, belieuing thoſe Chriſtian Verities; vnles we will ſay, there was no obligation vpon men, to belieue in God, and to worſhip him according to that beliefe, before the tyme of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> before the Scriptures were. For, was not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion obligatory before <hi>Moyſes?</hi> and was not the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> obliged to belieue and practiſe that tradition, as of diuine authority? of which our Sauiour ſayth: <hi>Moyſes dedit rebis Circumciſionem non quia ex Moyſe eſt, ſed ex Patribus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He will ſay, You proue the Church infallible by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, your Scriptures muſt be firſt belieued infallible. I anſwer we proue this out of Scriptures againſt ſuch as profeſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue Scriptures, not the Church, as out of their owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; it followeth not thence, that we firſt belieue the Scripturs diuine or infallible. For though in methode of confuting ſuch Aduerſaries, we begin with the Scriptures, yet in the methode of belieuing, we begin from the Church, vpon whoſe credit we belieue the Scriptures to be diuine; and according to this method, commencing from the Church, Chriſtian fayth was firſt propagated among nations, and imbraced by Heathens.</p>
                     <p>Nor will it be to the purpoſe to reply, that Heathens were induced to belieue by reaſon of miracles. This I ſay, is not to the purpoſe, how the Church gained this credit; but hence it is inferred that in regard of Chriſtian Beliefe, the Church had the Precedency before Scriptures; that is, the Church was belieued before the Scriptures were belieued. Wherefore, to conclude this point, if it be impiety, not to belieue Scriptures, (as no doubt it is) yet it is an impiety no way deducible from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the beliefe of an infallible Church, is precedent to the beliefe of Scriptures. But it is not hard to conceaue, by the very carriage of the buſines, as he handles it, what he driues at in all this diſcourſe: which is indeed to euacuate all authority, both of Church and Scriptures, and vpon the ruines of both, to build the Godles <hi>Socinianiſme.</hi> Therefore all inferences which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8626:51"/>may ſeeme any way to perplexe Chriſtian doctrine, or force it into ſtraits, are his aduantages.</p>
                     <p>It was the prudent induſtry of the Roman Conſull, to prouoke <hi>Catiline,</hi> whoſe ſecret practiſes and deſignes vpon the Common-Wealth he had vnderſtood, into open warre and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beilion; for he ſuppoſed, no Cittizen would then appeare in his defence, or make the oppreſſion of a Tyrant his quarrell: As no man would approue the fyering of the houſe wherein himſelfe were, or wracking the ſhippe wherein he ſayled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. I ſuppoſe likewiſe, if this pretended Champion for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy, were once diſcouered, and ſtrip't to the naked truth of what he is indeed, that is, as I haue ſaid, a very <hi>Socinian</hi> Mole, vnderworking euen Proteſtancy it ſelfe, and all Religion; no Proteſtant who hath any zeale of the Religion he profeſſeth, would euer be ſeene in his patronage, nor willingly, I thinke, in his company: nor would he vouchſafe, the ordinary gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſalutation, as <hi>good-morrow,</hi>

<q>— O parce viribus vſque tuis.</q> As if he had a mynd to recriminate and charge Papiſts, that <hi>they lead men into Socinianiſme,</hi> he cold certainly make a much fayrer ſhew of euidence then his Aduerſary hath done.</p>
                     <p>And truly, I belieue he hath met with an Aduerſarie, that will eaſily yeild him the priority in making faire ſhew's, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pref. If I had a mind to recriminate, I would not tell you, you deny the infallibility of the Church of England.</hi> Ergo, <hi>you lead to Socinianiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</hi> Which is altogether as good as this: <hi>Proteſtants deny the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Roman Church.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they induce Socinianiſme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet becauſe, this (I would not tell you) is no reall pretermiſſion, or paſſing ouer in ſilence, what he would ſay, but a ſaying it, after a more aduantagious and Emphatique manner of ſpeach, then if he had ſaid it poſitiuely, and in plaine termes; as the flight of warring <hi>Parthians</hi> is no ſerious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended flight, but a more dangerous fight, vnder ſhew and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of feare and flight: therefore we muſt vnderſtand theſe words according to the direct and poſitiue ſenſe; as though they were couch't in this forme. This argument, <hi>You deny the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church of England,</hi> Ergo, <hi>you lead to Socinianiſme,</hi> is as good as this; <hi>Proteſtants deny the infallibility of the Church of Rome,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they induce Socinianiſme.</hi> Wherein I note firſt, his moſt familiar Fallacy of willfull ignorance and miſtake of his Aduerſaries Argument, and the Elench; who neuer inferred <hi>leading</hi> or <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into Socinianiſme,</hi> out of the deniall of <hi>infallibility of the Roman Church,</hi> but out of the deniall of ſome <hi>infallibility of Iudgment,</hi> and authority of a Viſible Church to determine of Scriptures and their interpretation &amp;c. For he knew well, that if there were any other ſuch infallible authority to determine ſuch differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it ſhould not then follow that they who diſclayme the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Roman Church, ſhould haue their only remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning refuge, to the priuate ſpirit, or naturall iudgment &amp;c. Wherefore hauing not yet excluded all other infallibility, no nor diſputed it, he aſſumeth not infallibility of the Roman Church, or the deniall of that, as inducing <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> but the deniall of all infallibility of whatſoeuer Church.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if this Logician would haue played fayre, and not more like a Sophiſter then like a Scholler (which very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8626:53"/>in my iudgment, carrieth with it a face and promiſe of ingenuity) he ſhould haue framed his Aduerſaries Argument as it lyeth in him, or at leaſt, ſo as it might appeare the ſame in effect, and not ſeeme to haue his whole attention applyed to ſhift's and aduantages: thus then he ſhould haue formed it, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants deny infallibility to the Church of God,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they induce Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme,</hi> and then haue compared it with this his owne recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, <hi>Papiſts deny the infallibility of the Church of England,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they induce Socinianiſme,</hi> and then,

                     <p>Secondly in comparing the <hi>English</hi> with the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fallacy.</note> he ſeemes, no doubt, to take the <hi>Roman</hi> as a particular Church; fraudulently affecting not to know, that by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> Catholiques vnderſtand all Chriſtian Churches, making one with the <hi>Roman</hi> by obedience and ſubordination to it. Whence (by the way) <hi>Catholique Roman Church,</hi> is no Bull, as I haue heard a <hi>Dux Gregis</hi> among them, was pleaſed ſometyme to ſay it is.</p>
                     <p>And yet againe, how long hath the Engliſh <hi>Church</hi> made a part ſeparate from the <hi>Roman?</hi> Look back into her cradle of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or diſtraction rather, and bluſh not.

<q>Cauſa mali tanti &amp;c. —</q> But I know this Aduocate will eaſily ſhift all this; he will grant, for a need, True; the generation was Equiuocall, yet it might be Honourable inough; <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae leges &amp;c.</hi> of euill manners, good Laws &amp;c. I know his common place. Howſoeuer, in my iudgment, the compariſon hath ſomething of the odious.</p>
                     <p>But what hath this Retrograde to do with the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> He hath profe'ſt the infallibility of it ſo farre, as to deny to ſubſcribe the Engliſh Articles of fayth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8626:53"/>and doctrine; wherein the authority of this Church may ſeeme to appeare, of as great force as whereſoeuer. He may haue ſince beene wrought into ſome other opinion, by the skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of ſome ſuch Artiſt, as know's well how to deale with ſo pliable a nature;
<q>(Vdum &amp; molle lutum, nunc nunc properandus, &amp; acri Fingendus ſine fine rota;) —</q> Or that other, (though no Doctour, yet a maiſter of Art, — <hi>ingenique largitor,</hi>)

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet let them haue made of him what they can, or what they liſt, a Veſſell of Honour, or Contumely, (ſince by their all-ſufficient Canon of Scripture, they are vnqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for what they do, or make, of ſuch matter) yet I aſſure my ſelfe, he will neuer be able to make good this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, or parity; vntill he make it euident, when, and how that notorious change entred into the Roman Church, whence the Church of <hi>England</hi> receaued Chriſtian Religion: how, and when, I ſay, the Roman Church Apoſtated from her ſelfe. For vntill then, we ſhall neuer ceaſe to extoll in compariſon her firſt birth and entrance, firſt ſowne and planted by Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call euangelizing; then watred with the blood of two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Apoſtles, as is extant vpon record of irrefragable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: then, the entrance of the ſame Religion from thence propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, into other nations, togeather with the entrers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſame; all, men of knowne and eminent ſanctity: to extoll I ſay theſe entrances of the Roman Religion, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the infamous ingredientes of defection from that Church, into ſome of the ſame Nations, achieued by men, or monſters rather, of moſt celebrated infamy, and ſtigmatized Worders.</p>
                     <p>Had the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> needed reformation, were theſe likely or probable inſtruments? a Friar with his diſ-nun'd and de-uirginated Concubine? Or a ſecond branded, and inuſted

                     <p>The reſt which followeth in this 16. <hi>Paragraph</hi> concerning the Popes infallibility, is nothing elſe but rauing language, the ouerflowing &amp; exuberance of his pregnant paſſion.

Wherefore as he laboureth in behalf of Proteſtants to weaken, yea to aboliſh all infallibility of the Church of Chriſt; ſo he endeauours out of the doctrines of ſome Catholiques, to vnnerue the teſtimony of Scriptures, vpon the authority of which the whole fabrick of Proteſtancy is pretended to rely.</p>
                     <p>For who ſeeth not what aduantage, he with his <hi>Socinian</hi> Academy will draw from hence? As thus; Doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fayth, according to Proteſtants, cannot be proued by the Authority of the Church, for that authority with them is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Againe, ſome of them, in the opinion of Papiſts, cannot be ſufficiently proued by Scriptures, as that maine point of their fayth and hope, the miſtery of the Trinity; therfore if we harken to both, or belieue both (ſince whether rather to belieue we know not) it can no way be proued. Whence, with a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorus,</hi> the ſurnamed <hi>Atheos,</hi> or a <hi>Protagorus,</hi> concerning any ſuch thing as Trinity, and ſoone after, as Deity, they will returne a <hi>Non liquet,</hi> it is not certaine.</p>
                     <p>For me, who haue enterprized the diſcouery of his Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, together with ſome hidden driftes and mines alone, it ſhall not be neceſſary or requiſite to purſue his ſeuerall teſtimonies of Catholique Writers; they will do it, no doubt, at the leaſt ſo far forth, as they ſhall deeme it needfull, who vndertake the anſwere of this great Pamphlet; though, I verily thinke, it will proue <hi>magis operoſum quàm operae pretium,</hi> the harueſt will neuer render the ſeed, in ſo barren a field. And I do not know, but a man may ſuſpect he had a mind to entertaine his Aduerſary haſtning after him, in examining his witneſſes, were it but to ſlow his purſuite; like as <hi>Medea</hi> ſcattered her brothers bones in her flight from her Father, to retard their ſpeed who eagerly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8626:55"/>purſued her, while they ſtayd to gather them vp: Yet was ſhe neuer ſure ſo peeuiſh a ſhrew, as to quarrell with them, for not gathering them vp cleane, as this Aduocate doth in behalfe of his Clients ſcattered bones; which notwithſtanding I certainly thinke, his aduerſary either hath done or would haue gathered to a bone, if he had thought them indeed his bones, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome other watry, or aery ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Only after a more ſhort and generall way, I anſwere, as concerning thoſe Scriptures, out of which (as he ſayth) ſome of our Writers deny, that the <hi>Trinity</hi> can be conuinc't; <hi>ad hominem,</hi> thus: <hi>M. Ch.</hi> himſelfe hath denyed in the hearing of ſufficient witneſſes, that this point of Chriſtian beliefe, can be proued out of Scripture, and ſaid, that it can leſſe be ſo proued, then the Catholique doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which he with his <hi>Agonothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be proued by Scripture; he, the ſame denieth, that any point can be held as of diuine fayth, but what is proued out of Scripture; therefore he denieth that the Trinity is to be belieued as of diuine fayth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he belieues not the B. Trinity as a Chriſtian; therefore he is none. So by his owne doctrine, he leades himſelfe to <hi>Turciſme,</hi> or <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> or, <hi>to the diuell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if he haue a mynd to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreouer I anſwere: thoſe Catholique Writers, no doubt, from thoſe leſſe expreſſe and conuincing authorities of holy Scriptures, leſſe I ſay conuincing of themſelues, abſtracting from the authority of the Church, applying them in confirmation of this miſtery, gather a neceſſity of acknowledging the infallible authority of the Church, without which, notwithſtanding ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, we ſhould be in doubt how to belieue ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall point of Chriſtian beliefe. The neceſſity of which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, appeareth yet more euidently, euen by what he quarrells concerning the doctrines of <hi>Euſebius, Origen,</hi> and thoſe other queſtioned and controuled by the like authority of the Church. Againſt which authority no faculty of wit, and vnderſtanding, no eminency or glory of ſcience and erudition could preuaile; no not martyrdome it ſelf could protect any error againſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe beliefe, or eſcape the cenſure of this ſupreme Iudge on earth.</p>

But whither will not a theefe fly from the ſentence of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which can condemne him? And whither not, an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique from the Church? And who doubts, but the Church of Chriſt, is moſt repreſentatiuely, and iointly, and vnanimouſly in a generall Councell, as a kingdom in a Parlament or full ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; in which myſticall body then, as euer, yea then more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and actiuely then euer, the holy Ghoſt, as the ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, moueth and directeth.

                     <p>The ground of which diſcourſe, may be this, or the like: Naturall reaſon, as ſuch, apprehendeth not ſupernaturall truth, becauſe ſuch truth is aboue reaſon, though not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yea rather, euery truth is reaſonable, and conforme to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon truly conceauing.

                     <p>For this Supremacy, euen in ſpirituall commaund, being once granted to naturall Reaſon, with authority to direct and

Thus Reaſon is made the God of ſuch men; and becauſe ſo made, a very Idoll; and all <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> is Idolatry, yea the laſt, and loweſt, and baſeſt I dolatry; and whither Hereticall Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Many a one loueth the Father, who loues not the child; yet that beloued Father, is the parent of that vnlouely child.

                     <p>Let him firſt cleare his maintainers from this imputation, that <hi>Socianiſme</hi> is the effect of Proteſtancy; or let him ſhew at leaſt by ſolid arguments, that it is not the naturall iſſue of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy, but as a monſtrous birth not intended (I do not ſay by Proteſtants, but by Proteſtancy, according to a Phiſicall &amp; neceſſary, though not a morall and expreſſely voluntary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,) or laſtly that the generation is meerly caſuall and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionall: Then let them ſay, they deteſt and abhorre it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their deteſtation is like theirs who deteſt the ſhame of ſinne, but loue the ſinne.</p>

As, if a hundred load of Hay, or (if that be fitter for his purpoſe) ſtraw, were laid vp in one rick or barne, which laid before ſcatter'd in the fields or meadows in a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cocks, though the hay, or ſtraw be the very ſame in quantity or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of load's, yea though it were Iayd togeather which ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther load's that neuer grew in thoſe field's or meadow's; yet no man will deny, but that hay, or ſtraw ſo rick't, or howſ'd, lye's now in a more cloſe manner, and a narrower roome, then as ſcattered in the fields or meadow's: which more narrow and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8626:63"/>cloſe compreſſion, and collection, is in effect the ſame with our ſuccinctnes of method in School-diuinity. Would <hi>Cato</hi> laugh at this?

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8626:73"/>proued no otherwiſe, but by his owne words and actions, which if they haue vpon ſeuerall occaſions, before many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes proclamed his iudgment concerning points of Chriſtian Religion, to harmonize with the doctrines and principles of knowne and profeſt <hi>Socinians;</hi> ſurely theſe are preſumptions ſtrong inough, at leaſt as ſtrong as can be expected, in queſtion of iudgment and opinions of men.</p>
                     <p>But now, to the ſubſtance of the charge he ſaith nothing; onely he attemps to diſproue the motiues: that is, to proue thoſe temporall ends, to haue beene no motiues of his change; which yet is more then he doth, or can do. Therfore in behalfe of thoſe preſumed ends, and in confirmation of that preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus I argue; only ſuppoſing firſt, that he was in his wits when he made the change, that it was voluntary; and then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that no man in his wits, and voluntarily maketh any change but for ſome end or ends; then thus: Whoſoeuer may out of his owne words and demeanours be conuinced to haue changed religion, for no religion, may be conuinced to haue changed for temporall ends: But <hi>M.

My reaſon; becauſe <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme</hi> bindeth no man to profeſſe it publiquely, nay, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth no obligation to any exterior act whatſoeuer, which may yield the leaſt ſent, or ſuſpicion of it; nay rather by the maine principle of it, <hi>(ſana ratio)</hi> right reaſon, ſuch as they terme right, which ſo appeareth to euery man in particular, they are obliged to exhibit no ſigne or ſhew at all, which may hinder or croſſe their deſignes: therefore <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> obligeth rather to all exteriour conformity.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore all Hereſy is ſubiect to change and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, alterable by the authority by which it ſtands; the <hi>Socinian</hi> of all other is moſt ready to change with it; and to conforme himſelfe to any Church, or ſtate whatſoeuer; as the waxe as yet vnprinted is capable of any impreſſion; and the Eye hauing in it ſelf no colour, receaues the formes or idols of all colours. Therefore in ſuch a Church or State, no Sect is endued with ſo great aduantages as <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> is, which can without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty or demurre put on the guiſe and liuery of any profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The <hi>Socinian</hi> can be a <hi>Puritan</hi> to day, to morrow a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> the third day an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and the fourth an <hi>Arrian;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo, or ſo; or neither ſo, nor ſo.</p>
                     <p>Nor can I doubt but this is indeed the very principall cauſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8626:75"/>why ſo many make this choyce. For the <hi>Socinian</hi> is the only He, who ſayles with euery wynd, whiles other profeſſors, ſome out of tenderneſſe or ſcruple, iniected by the principles of their doctrine, dare not yeild to the countermaund of ſecular authority; others out of animoſity of oppoſition, or, as it were, the pride of their choyce, will not conforme; others out of the extreme hate of what they feare (the hate, I ſay, of that truth which they feare will preuaile) will not come in; and while all theſe, either by their not yielding, or by direct oppoſition, run hazard of their fortunes, yea liues and liberty; the ſmooth-faced <hi>Socinian</hi> arides euery change; derides the folly of Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants; ſwims aloft like a Corke; fall's and riſes with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues; whatſoeuer ſtormes againſt religion, or be the ſeas neuer ſo rough, he will neuer drowne: in briefe, he is the one <hi>Pamphylus</hi> and <hi>Eutrapelus</hi> of tymes and fortunes, the only State-humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and State-complyer. He might paſſe for a very wiſeman in ſome heathen Philoſophy; a very Atheiſt in Chriſtianity.

                     <p>It hath beene the vſuall Practiſe of all hereticall writers, to embelliſh their diſcourſes, with as many verities as they could poſſibly inculcate, without apparent contradiction or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.

<q>Neſcis quam pro melaudat nunc iſte Sicambram.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reſt which followeth in this Prefatory Anſwere to the <hi>Direction,</hi> and immediatly precedeth his Concluſion, is a briefe recollection (as it ſeemes) of what is ſcattered in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Volume, truſt vp together with a number of points, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all to one chiefe point, and maine head of Doctrine, which is indeed a moſt falſe Principle in the ſenſe he pretendeth; <hi>That all things neceſſary to Saluation are euidently contained in Scriptures.</hi> Whence it will follow, that the beliefe of the B. Trinity is not neceſſary to Saluation, as which, in this Aduocates opinion (as I haue noted heretofore) is not euidently reuealed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                     <p>And yet grant this principle true; it will follow, that the authority determining Controuerſies of fayth, cannot be the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8626:78"/>Scripture, but the Church; for it is notorious that ſome Her eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrines haue beene grounded vpon ſome ineuident paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture, and thoſe vented as doctrines of fayth, and therefore as neceſſarily to be belieued, or at the leaſt not reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by an expreſſe misbeliefe.</p>
                     <p>Againe, ſome parts of Scripture may haue an euident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to one, which to another may be darke and obſcure; then the doctrine inferred vpon that euidence, will be of fayth to him to whom it is euidently contained in Scripture; to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who will deny the euidence, becauſe he ſee's it not, it will not be ſo: What authority then, other then the Church ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the true ſenſe of this part of Scripture, euident and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, eſpecially (which may often fall out) if no other more euident Scripture, can be brought in, as a witneſſe of greater authority to cleare the doubt?</p>
                     <p>Heere then the doctrine of Fundamentalls and not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, will be good for nothing, but to bring in more Fayths, yea contradictory Fayths; ſince all points of Fayth are Fundamentall, ſo as neceſſarily to be belieued by him to whom they are euidently contained in Scripture; and none funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to him, to whom they are not euidently contained in Scripture, and therefore not neceſſary to be belieued.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay, that ſuch points euidently contained in regard of ſome vnderſtanding, not euidently to another, are none of thoſe which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be preached to all men (which euaſion this Aduocate may ſeeme to haue reſerued,) how will this be proued? ſince our Sauiours commaund is in general termes this, <hi>Praedicate Euangelium hoc omnicreaturae.</hi> Preach this Ghoſpell to all the world; he ſayth not, theſe, or theſe points of the Ghoſpell, and no more. And yet againe: <hi>Quod aeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distis in aurem praedicate ſuper tectae,</hi> what you haue heard in ſecret, preach it publiquely.</p>
                     <p>But eſpecially when any controuerſy concerning do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of fayth ariſeth, and ſome Hereſy is authorized by ſome ſuppoſed euidence of Scripture, then the contrary truth is to be preach't and publiſh't to the whole Church, leaſt that Hereſy ſhould be imbraced for a truth of Fayth, or the word of God; yea God himſelfe pretended the Author of that vntruth, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8626:78"/>which pretence is a very high and low'd Blaſphemy.</p>
                     <p>By which may appeare the groſſe and palpable abſurdity of this Miniſters doctrine, legitimating as it were all Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſuprious Doctrines, and Hereſies, by ſaying; <hi>Nothing that is obſcure can be neceſsary, to be vnderſtood, or not mistaken.</hi> Which is indeed one of his capitall Principles, and a chiefe ſupport of his doctrine.</p>
                     <p>For I aske, Is not the miſtaking, or miſinterpreting of ſome parts of Scripture the very ſource of ſome Hereticall doctrines? and thoſe Scriptures the greateſt ſtrength and colour, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth credit and countenance to ſuch Hereſies? Is not then, the not-miſtaking of ſuch Scriptures neceſſary, euen as neceſſary, as it is that ſuch doctrines ſhould not preuaile, or win credit by the authority of thoſe Scriptures? For though the true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſome obſcure parts of Scripture be not neceſſary, yet it is neceſſary that ſuch obſcure parts be not ſo miſtaken as to warrant Hereſy by their authority.</p>
                     <p>If therefore out of that firſt principle, by this Miniſter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, a thouſand other abſurdities follow, ſuch as thoſe, by him deduced howſoeuer, (for I will not examine the regularity of thoſe deductions) what is this to the matter in hand? For this was not the Direction or Caueat giuen him by his Aduerſary, that he ſhould not anſwere out of this principle of Proteſtancy; but that he ſhould not out of thoſe other ſpecified by his Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, thoſe <hi>Socinian</hi> principles, which euen Proteſtants abhorre.</p>

                        <p>That ſuch ſeparation from the Church is ſchiſmaticall, is euident; for ſchiſme being the breach of vnion in Charity, as Hereſy violates the vnity of faith; to ſeparate from the externall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8626:86"/>communion of this Church, is to ſhew you are fallen out with the Church, with which you refuſe to conuerſe in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conuerſation; as he who flyeth the company of a man with whome he hath beene formerly familiar in way of ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, is ſuppoſed to be fallen out with him. Then againe, this ſeparation is very ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalous, as yeilding a iuſt preſumption that ſuch a Separant is in his iudgment an Heretique. Now, to ſcandalize wittingly and knowingly (as ſuch a Separate cannot be ignorant that this is a true cauſe of ſcandall, or if he be, he is wilfully ignorant) is to violate the law of Charity, and this eſpecially when you ſeparate from a Church wherein nothing neceſſary to Saluation is wanting, as you make the ſuppoſition: But if this Church wanting nothing neceſſary (as you ſuppoſe) require you to profeſſe againſt your conſcience that you belieue ſome error; then (ſay you) your Separation is lawfull.</p>
                        <p>But either this error required by the Church to be belieued, is in your conſcience an error of doctrine concerning fayth or manners, or no: If yea; then in your conſcience ſomewhat neceſſary is wanting to that Church, that is, the contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of truth. If it be no error of doctrine concerning either of theſe, but only ſome opinion held or practized as indifferent; then certainly the Church will neuer vrge you to belieue it: &amp; then againe you may chooſe whether you will belieue it or no: and then laſtly you ſhould haue no cauſe for this, to breake with the Church, or deuide your ſelfe from her Communion. If you ſay, in the iudgment of the Church it may perhaps be held indifferent, yea perhaps a neceſſary point of doctrine; but to my conſcience it is an error in faith or manners: Now this I expected, and this I knew you ſaid in your hart: ſo then I ſay againe, in your iudgement and conſcience the Church is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſome neceſſary point of true doctrine.</p>
                        <p>And heere now I appeale to the ſentence of any ſober and indifferent Chriſtian, what greater pride can be imagined, then that any priuate or ſingle man ſhould haue a conſcience repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and refragatory to the conference of the Church of God?

                        </p>
                        <p>Now for my part, I truly ſhould haue had a very great Scruple, to haue imprinted vpon your reputation ſuch a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a prodigious pride, as you haue heere diſplayed with your owne hand and pen. For as I haue intimated before it is certaine (yea, and to ſurmiſe the contrary, or draw it within ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or iealouſy, is mere litigious cauilling) that the Church will neuer require the beliefe of ſo ſmall and innocent an error, as includeth no preiudice or falſhood againſt Catholique faith, or manners; and if it include any ſuch, it cannot be ſmall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Yet put the caſe, that the Church ſhould require of any ſingle or priuate Chriſtian, that he would for peace ſake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend with the whole Catholique Church, to the profeſſion of ſome point of doctrine, which euen in his iudgment were but a ſmall and innocent error, but in her iudgment an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe truth though not yet defined; and would aduiſe him to depoſe his ſingle conſcience, in this point, wherein he could not poſſibly be ſuppoſed to haue any conuincing euidence, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially againſt the torrent and vnanimous conſent of the whole Church; and that finally in caſe he would not ſubmit, he ſhould be excommunicate &amp; held an alien from the Church: were it not a ſtrange pride in ſuch a man, to ſay: No, he could not, and ſo would not depoſe his conſcience; that he know's he is in the right, and the whole Church in an errour, (for thus we muſt ſuppoſe according to the ſenſe of this Motiue, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſtood out ſingle againſt the whole Church) and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnleſſe the Church will allow him her Communion v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his owne termes and conditions, that is, without obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his part to any ſuch profeſſion of doctrine, or practiſe of the whole Church, he would diſclaime her communion and proclaime her ſchiſmaticall, for requiring from him any ſuch concurrence with her, in any ſuch practiſe, or exterior confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                        <p>Although (by the way) <hi>Luther,</hi> for whome he apologizeth,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8626:88"/>oppoſed the whole Church, in points of fayth then already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; when thoſe errors (if errors) were neither ſmall nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, being now impoſed vpon Chriſtians to be belieued, euen as they would belieue God himſelf: I ſay, no error ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or ſo authorized could be ſmall or innocent; but if an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at all, a moſt grieuous and damnable impoſture. Or if they were true doctrines, and then alſo defined by the Church, then <hi>Luther</hi> and his ſectaries, by not belieuing them, and for ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (according to your former diſcourſe) from that Church, &amp; all the Churches of the world, and ſo from the true, (if there were any true) were damnable Schiſmatique<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And yet further let vs conſider your Apology for this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata, perſonated in your ſelfe. <hi>In this caſe the Church not allowing me her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion is ſchiſmaticall, not I for ſeparating.</hi> Reflect ſeriouſly vpon this diſcourſe, whether it be, not only vnchriſtian, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous and illiterate, nor worthy to haue dropt from a Grammarians Pen, much leſſe from a maiſter of Art's, or of a Chaire. For if <hi>Luther,</hi> or any ſuch, whom you act in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, were euer in the Church, from which he ſeparates, he was in it, as a limbe, or member in the whole body; for example, as an arme, or legge, or thigh &amp;c.

                           <p>Now certainly you are a ſtrange Aduocate, and will ſhame your Clyents, do what we can.

Yet firſt, I note your illiterate manner of expreſſion in ſaying, <hi>that God permits ſome true miracles;</hi> as though true miracles were wrought by Gods permiſſion only, not by his poſitiue concourſe and direct intention: by reaſon of which poſitiue concourſe it is truly ſaid of euery true miracle, <hi>digitus Dei his eſt,</hi> the fingar of God is heere, as being his worke alone: ſo his alone, that no power or force of nature, hath any naturall influence into it; and wherunto nature may ſeeme to affoard nothing elſe but a certain non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance, and ſubmiſſion to the prerogatiue power of God; &amp; which therfore, rather Nature thou God may be ſaid to permit.</p>
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:8626:92"/>
                           <p>And tell me now, good Syr, ſeemes it not ſtrange to you that God ſhould poſitiuely and directly worke a true miracle in confirmation of a falſhood? (for if it be in confirmation of a truth, then it deludes not) that God ſhould truly lye, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of fact and reality, ſaying by his miracle. This is true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is falſe; or, this is Vertue, which is Vice, or the like? For although Almighty God may permit the abuſe, and wicked application of ſome ſupernaturall worke, whereunto he concurreth poſitiuely, as when he concurs poſitiuely with the Prieſt, conſecrating to ſome miſchieuous end (if we will imagine ſo great impiety,) yet it followeth not, that God can concurre poſitiuely, to other miracles, with him who intends impoſture or confirmation of falſe doctrine, by them. For the power of conſecrating giuen to the Prieſt, is a permanent, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and conſiſtent power, like vnto the naturall faculties of man, wherewith as by vertue of a former pact and law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God concurreth poſitiuely, in order to the naturall effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, or exerciſe of thoſe faculties, and to the Phyſicall entity of their effects, howſoeuer oftentymes morally, and formally ſinfull: which law and couenant ſuppoſed, the abuſe of ſuch naturall power, is the ſole worke and attribute of man, only permitted by God.</p>
                           <p>But the power of other miracles, not appropriated to fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Character, or ſuch as to which God hath not obliged himſelfe, by any former compact with any man, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that power in him, or to concurre with it, to any miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effect, is in no man reſident, but rather fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Qui non vetat peccare, cùm poteſt, iubet.</q> For to this kind of miracles, if God ſhould concurre poſitiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſhould ſeeme to concurre directly to the abuſe of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous application, which God forbid we ſhould euer ſay or thinke with <hi>Caluin.</hi>

This inference euery Logician, or man of common ſenſe ſees, hath no force at all. But againe, the force of the Motiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this: That thoſe Propheſies concerning Conuerſions, haue beene actually fulfilled, in, and by the Catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church; which is indeed a waighty inducement to belieue that to be the true Church, foreſignified by the ſpirit of God, wherein thoſe ſignes wherewith God hath fore-marked and predeſigned the true Church, are euident to be ſeen: then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, if thoſe ſignes and markes of the true Church, are not to be found in the Proteſtant, this ought in reaſon to induce a man to belieue that the Proteſtant is not the true Church. For where the connexion betweene the ſigne and the thing ſigned, is indiuiſible, there the inference is good, proceeding from the deſtruction of the ſigne, to the deſtruction, or deniall of the thing ſigned or ſignified. As to ſay, heere is not the indiuiſible ſigne: <hi>Ergo,</hi> heere is not the thing ſigned. This I ſay, ſuppoſing ſuch infallible Connexion, which in this caſe ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſuch deuine prediction, and the veracity of God being preſuppoſed, which tyeth the ſigne and the thing ſigned togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an inuiolable and indiſſoluble knot. I ſay further; that it is falſe, that Nations haue been conuerted to the true Religion of Chriſt, by men of contrary Religions; which thus I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Thoſe contrary Religions, or Profeſſions of Religion though they might be both, or all falſe; yet both or all could not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8626:94"/>be true; as the Roman Orator ſayth well, pronouncing vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally of diſſenting opinions. Now, of the true Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting men to the true, there is no queſtion; but of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or repugnant to the true. Thus I argue: Either the Profeſſors of a falſe Religion, taught and preacht' according to their falſe principles, or doctrine; and then by thoſe, they neuer conuerted any to the true Religion; or elſe they taught true principles and true doctrine of Chriſtian fayth. If ſo; then, if by thoſe true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they conuerted men to Chriſtian fayth, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were not true Chriſtians, yet they conuerted, as agreeing and conſenting with the true Religion, not as oppoſers, or as men of a contrary Religion. As if a heathen ſhould baptize by applying the matter and forme of baptiſme, with intention to do what Chriſtians are wont to do, by the like application; then not Heatheniſme, but Chriſtian Religion baptizeth by a Heathen.</p>
                        <p>Nor can this Argument be retorted by the Proteſtant, for it will eaſily be made to appeare that Catholiques haue conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nations, to, and by thoſe doctrines wherein they diſſent from proteſtants: whereas neither Proteſtants, nor any other oppugners of the Catholique, will euer be found to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Nations by preaching the doctrine wherein they diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from the Catholique: but moreouer as for the Proteſtants, they neuer conuerted any, neither by their diſagreeing, nor agreeing doctrines.</p>
                        <p>Nay euen this confirmes (if at any tyme it ſo fall out) the truth and efficacy of Chriſtian Religion, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe prophetique Predictions, when euen the alien, or oppoſer of true Religion, who can achieue no one Conuerſion to Chriſtianity by his owne repugnant doctrine, can, and doth effect it, by vertue of Chriſtian Truth: which, I ſay, this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that any ſuch Precedent may be cited out of antiquity of ſome Conuerſion to Chriſtian Religion wrought by an alien Profeſſour; though the entire Conuerſion of a nation, by any ſuch ſeparate inſtrument, I belieue, hath no Precedent in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient memory.

It is vntrue, that any learned Papiſt confeſſeth, that the doctrine of faith of moderne Papiſts, is contrary to the doctrine of the Fathers in any point of faith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defined by the Church. If from ſome they differ in ſome point now defined, then not defined; this is no formall contrariety in points of faith; that is, as they are points of fayth obligatory to belief, which they are not before they be defined by the Church: which being the ſole infallible interpreter of diuine reuelation, by propounding any point of doctrine as diuinely reuealed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8626:95"/>makes it now formally the obiect of neceſſary beliefe, which was before only materially ſuch.</p>
                        <p>But neither againe in regard of ſuch differences is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of ſome opinions, betweene the moderne Papiſts, and ſome of the ancient Fathers, any formall oppoſition.

Howſoeuer he appeare in all other points of Chriſtian doctrine an Angell of light, by this you ſhall diſcerne him, as by a clouen foot; with this ſubmiſſion no Hereticall opinion, can make a man an Heretique: without, this, the whole Apoſtolique Creed cannot make him a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, <hi>(ſi per impoſsibile)</hi> if it were poſſible, that ſuch ſubmiſſion ſhould be wanting in him who belieues entirely the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Creed.</p>

Promotiue.</label> Extraordinary miſſion or commiſſion is immediately from God: Ordinary miſſion or Commiſſion is that which iſſueth immediatly from man, placed in authority vnder God. Now to proue an ordinary miſſion or commiſſion, is eaſily done by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the teſtimony of that authority which ſendeth, or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the commiſſion. Extraordinary miſſions cannot be proued or manifeſted by ordinary manifeſtations; and being not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, cannot oblige to acceptance, or beliefe. Now ſince to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme is an act of power and authority; and all power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is from God, whether mediatly or immediatly, hence it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8626:96"/>is, that no ſuch act, can be legall or regular, and ſo effectuall and valid of it ſelf, without miſſion or commiſſion, that is, without receauing ſuch power or authority to reforme, from him, who hath power to giue it; that is, from God himſelf immediatly, or mediatly from his Officers.</p>
                        <p>Since then thoſe pretended Reformers had, or could proue no ſuch miſſion or commiſſion, neither immediately nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, hence it followeth, that they had none at all: no authority. Pſay, at all to reforme the Church: <hi>Ergo</hi> their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformation, was an illegall, and irregular act of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                        <p>It is true, a Commiſſion may be of two kinds reſpectiuely to circumſtances: It may be either an expreſſe and formall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or interpretatiue only. The expreſſe and formall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is that, which I receaue expreſſely granted by ſuperior authority: Interpretatione I may call that, which though I haue not expreſſely receaued from ſuch authority; yet I prudently and vndoubtingly ſuppoſe would be granted me in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of tyme, place &amp;c. if the Superior had notice of them: vpon which ſuppoſed and prudently preſumed grant, yea and direct will of the Superior, I execute ſuch an act of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to reforme, reprebend, teach, preach &amp;c.

                           <q>— An qui amant ipſiſibi ſomma fingunt?</q> Surely t'is you who dreame that <hi>Luther</hi> dreamed, becauſe you would haue it ſo; otherwiſe you cannot chooſe but know by him, that he dreamed not, if you will belieue him, who ſutely knew whether he were waking or ſleeping when the Diuell cour'ſt him; otherwiſe you make the Diuell a very dull and Phlegmatique courſer. I haue ſeen much courſing in my dayes, but neuer knew any man who ſlept while he was cours't; yet I cannot but admire your iudgment, and diſcretion, that you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belieue <hi>Luther</hi> in what he teacheth againſt the Church, then what he teſtifieth of his owne certaine knowledge: but this was properly and prouidently added by you <hi>(for ought I know)</hi> for I thinke you were not preſent at the diſputation; no, you were then but an <hi>Embrie</hi> of Proteſtantiſme; no nor ſo much, but only exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>in virtute cauſarum;</hi> ſo, for ought you know, it was nothing but a melancholy dreame. Yea and perhaps, for ought you know, he wal'kt too in his ſleepe, when (as he confeſſeth of himſelfe,) he oftentymes walk't with the Diuell in his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; that ſome of his Diuels with whome he conuerſed ſo familiarly, were braue Diuels, Doctours of diuinity, Doctours of the Chaire among the Diuels; this he dream'd too. Now I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuſpect theſe were the diſputant Diuels, who diſputed him out of the Maſſe: and being ſuch great Doctors of Diuinity, ſure, they would ſcorn to take hold of ſuch an aduantage to diſpute with him while he ſlep't. For they, no doubt, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a victory, which had beene none if he had beene a ſleepe while they diſputed; therefore I verily thinke, he was broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking, as he himſelfe teaches.</p>
                        <p>But did he indeed, trow you M. Aduocate, eat ſo much ſalt with the Diuell, as he ſaith he did? It little appear's by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or did he but dreame he eat ſalt, too? For ſurely, he was a very freſhman in diuinity, who would be driuen out of his ſaith by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8626:98"/>a dreame; or becauſe he could not defend it againnſt the Diuell waking, he ſleeping. But ſince you reſerue ſo many euaſions to eſcape this Diuelliſh diſputation with <hi>Luther,</hi> as not denying that he had ſuch a Conference, euen waking, with the waking Diuell, but that it might be otherwiſe; &amp; then againe <hi>(for ought you know,)</hi> we will preſſe you no further with this; yet when you made this Conference of <hi>Luther</hi> with the Diuell your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, not to belieue <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, authorized or ſuggeſted by the Diuell, you then knew no more, then now you know, that is, <hi>for ought you knew, it might be but a melancholy dreame:</hi> ſo this part of your Motiue ſtand's in the ſame force which then it had.</p>

                           <p>Certainly you haue taught the Diuell a leſſon of Policy, for which he will thinke himſelfe obliged to teach you many. In the mean tyme, this is a very tranſcendent anſwere, and applyable to many a ſolid blaſphemy. If the Diuell had perſuaded <hi>Luther</hi> to preach againſt the Bleſſed Trinity, (as who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer preacheth or teacheth againſt it, may be preſumed, I thinke, to do it by his perſwaſion, and ſomewhat to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I haue heard whiſper'd of a certaine <hi>Socinian,</hi> who ſtickles for Proteſtancy) why might not a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to this likewiſe, that the Diuell perſwaded him this, to keepe him more conſtant to the beliefe of the Trinity? So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if <hi>Arius</hi> were ſaid to haue beene perſwaded by the Diuels arguments to preach, or write againſt the Equality, or Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality of the Sonne of God, with God the Father; why might not the <hi>Arian</hi> to whom this ſhould be obiected, anſwere, the Diuell did it, to keepe him more conſtant to the beliefe of Conſubſtantiality?</p>
                           <p>Syr, I am ſory you are become ſo priuate and inward with the Diuell, that you can diue into his intentions, and acquaint your ſelfe with them, better, then he who had eat ſo much ſalt with him; who had his company at bed and board, as daily, and as nightly, as his owne reueyled <hi>Catharine.</hi> But do you not ſee, what a gappe you lay open to a moſt outragious blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when you teach Heretiques, to make the Diuell a Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghiſt, and an Apoſtle of Chriſtian doctrine; and what he doth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8626:98"/>himſelfe, he might do by others, his inſtruments? So then the of-ſpring and poſterity of thoſe Heretiques who denyed, that the ſonne of God ſuffered death vpon the croſſe, might be ſaid to haue beene perſwaded by the Diuell to preach that deniall, to the end to keep them cloſer to the beliefe of Chriſts Paſſion.</p>
                           <p>Now, I ſee you ſo wholy taken vp in your extraordinary miſſions, and extraordinary Courſes, that I doubt you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, or deride what I ſhall propoſe concerning the Diuels or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary miſſions: Otherwiſe I ſhould hope to moue you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that the Diuels Apoſtles doindeed belieue the Diuell, and execute his charges and commaunds in preaching falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.

                        <p>For what more ordinary Rendeuous of all Heretiques then Prouocation from the Church to Scripture? But, no; we are deceaued; for in this way of diſcourſe, wherein you reiect all ordinary meanes of ſuppreſſing Hereſies, you take a ſhorter courſe to aboliſh Hereſy it ſelfe; yea to exterminate the very name and eſſence of it <hi>è rerum naturâ,</hi> out of the world, nay out of the vnderſtanding of man, that there ſhall not remaine the very notion or definition of it; which is a more vniuerſall and totall abolition and ſuppreſſion, then if the whole world were regeſted and reconfounded into the firſt <hi>Chaos,</hi> or nothing, of it.</p>
                        <p>For how can there be, or euer haue beene any ſuch thing as Hereſy in coherence with this diſcourſe? For was there euer Heretique who could not pretend his endeauour to vnderſtand the Scripture in the true ſenſe? yea, and ſufficient endeauour, (excluding the authority of the Church, Councels &amp;c. by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying all the forces of his natural wit &amp; perſonall abilities? &amp; who can ſay he employed not his endeauour by all theſe?

                        <p>Who can ſay now, that <hi>Arius</hi> was an Heretique? or <hi>Eutyches</hi> an Heretique? or <hi>Manichaus</hi> an Heretique?

                        <p>
                           <hi>Remot. For he that belieues the Scripture ſyncerely, and endeauours to belieue it in the true ſenſe, cannot poſsibly be an Heretique.</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8626:102"/>Scripture-phraſe; who I ſay ſhall be able to conuince his want of endeauour to belieue the Scripture in the true ſenſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being required to belieue that only, and no man liuing, nor nothing elſe? who can condemne him for an Heretique, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he belieue, or belieue not?</p>

Where fall they into one way? Yes; you poynt me out the very place, where after many wyndings, and <hi>Meanders,</hi> they fall as riuers into one Sea, that is the Scripture endeauoured to be belieued in the true ſenſe. But good Syr, Scripture in all thoſe ſenſes is not Scripture, is not the word of God; nether doth any mans ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auour to belieue it in the true ſenſe, make it the word of God, as it is vnderſtood, in a falſe.</p>
                        <p>But it is the word of God, you will ſay, perhaps, to them who conceaue it ſo.
